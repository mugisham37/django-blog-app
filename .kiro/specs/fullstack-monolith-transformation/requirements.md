# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of an existing Django Personal Blog API project into a comprehensive enterprise-grade fullstack monolithic architecture. The transformation will create a scalable, maintainable, and production-ready system that combines Django backend services with Next.js frontend applications, shared packages, and enterprise-level infrastructure components.

The goal is to restructure the current project into a domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns, shared reusable packages, and tight integration between frontend and backend services while maintaining the benefits of a monolithic deployment model.
